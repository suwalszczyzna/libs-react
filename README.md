* atomic design
* custom hooks
* __infinity scroll__ made with [Intersection Observer API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API)
* __debounce__ in form, reduces api calls
* __custom backend__, made with Python and DRF: [libs-django](https://github.com/suwalszczyzna/libs-django)

# Quick install

3. Export necessary env variables:  
    ```
    REACT_APP_API_BACKEND_URL = "https://libs-django.herokuapp.com/api/"
